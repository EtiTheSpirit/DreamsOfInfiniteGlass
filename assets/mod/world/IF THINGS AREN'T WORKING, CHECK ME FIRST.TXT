This document is a list of things you did that break convention, for future Xan:

Did you add a swarm room? Hives not rendering?
	>	This room needs a _keywords.txt file (see 16/keywords_template.txt) that contains #define IS_SWARM_ROOM.
		The level shader will skip all swarm room rendering code without this macro defined.

Prop custom colors wrong (fading with the background)?
	>	You need to #define USE_EXACT_PROP_COLORS

Lagging on the render thread?
	>	Check the coherence flags. Make sure coherence is enabled when there's large areas of skybox or sunlight,
		or if its patchy, disable coherence flags.
