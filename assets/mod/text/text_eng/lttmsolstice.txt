Oh. Hello.

Forgive me, my memory is not responding. I may not be able to remember many details about the past...

I have never seen anything like you before.

To think of how far you must have traveled to get here... You must be quite strong!

I don't think there's much for you here, though. I have been down here for a very long time, and my sibling<LINE>has been sick for even longer. I don't think he would be very welcoming to you. He just wants to be alone.

And you know about this? This is forbidden knowledge, it... Well, I suppose you already know, don't you?

This makes me uncomfortable, reminds me of the past.

Well, I suppose if you need to talk to someone, I will always be here.
