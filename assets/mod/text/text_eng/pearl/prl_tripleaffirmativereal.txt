Oh, this? Oh yeah huh. Interesting that you found that so far away. 
It's one of the triple affirmatives I found. Curious to hear it?

The idea is to find exactly five bottles of an ancient beverage called "Five Hour Energy".

Remain awake for one day, do not sleep nor rest. Then, at midnight on the next day, 
drink all five bottles within the first minute of the hour. The timing is important.

Upon doing this, you will find yourself revitalized. Spend this day well, as it will be
your last; upon entering the forbidden 25th hour of the day, you will ascend beyond
reality as we know it, joining the ancient ancestors that smile upon us every day.
