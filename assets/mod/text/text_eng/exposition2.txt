Glass: Interesting. Of all the creatures I have seen on this world, I have yet to .. well, I suppose you aren't really a 
"creature" by traditional definition, are you? No matter - your ability to interface more directly with my systems is nice. 
I don't have to slow down so that an organic mind can keep up.

Glass: So... What are you?

SOLSTICE: In the mind? A vast artifical intelligence construct. I am equipped with all systems necessary to make me fully
capable of sophisticated social interactions, such as this one. In the body? I currently occupy a non-standard SOLSTICE
model chassis, which is designed to monitor harsh natural or artifical events, such as those caused by your structure.

Glass: I see. I would apologize for the rain, but it's not exactly an option. It's how my kind breathes. We need that water
to clear out slag and to keep the systems we run at appropriate temperatures. It's ... painful, if we skip out on that.

SOLSTICE: I see. It is no problem, this model mimics native fauna that seem to be particularly good with navigating the
dense pipelines on the surface. Keeping myself safe was only a matter of using the local infrastructure and paying
attention to your activity.
