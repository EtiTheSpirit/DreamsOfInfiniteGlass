Hey, Glass here.

I see you browsing this folder. Before you do anything, here's a reminder that I use a 
custom conversation format that doesn't encrypt the text.

Ordinarily, encryption would be used to hide sensitive information, but in this case it's
because you'll spoil yourself on my story if you read any of these!

If you are a curious developer, you can find full documentation on the conversation format
in the debug folder. Enjoy.
