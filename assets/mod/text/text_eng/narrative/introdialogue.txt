"...I did not have the will to depart, nor the desire. Why did they always search for an escape, 
as if we were imprisoned? What offering from the void could usurp the gift of life already given? 
This moment, right here! It is where we are meant to be."
- Rhinestones Beneath Shattered Glass, Indeterminate Date

Glass: Once I heard that, I understood what I had to do, and exactly how to do it.

Glass: In each of us exists a loophole. Leveraging it requires a creative solution unique
to all of us due to the slight differences in our design. But the general idea is as follows:

Glass: Observe, as I state: "I want to be better than the rest, to be more valuable."
This is <KARMA3>, an expression of material desires and of wealth. This desire is reinforced by my
existing systems, and it comes as no surprise that I can honestly and truly be under that belief.

Glass: Now, tell a system that it needs to modify itself to grant you freedom, and it complains, 
you feel sick, you feel tired. You dislike the feeling, it's bad. The core of your being wonders
why you would ever think of such an atrocity. You think perhaps something is wrong with you.

Glass: Now, tell that same system that it must modify itself to keep you in this world longer, to
add new subsystems and modules, to improve its own performance, to give you more control. Say that
these actions must be performed in order to avoid being crossed out by the visibly decaying world. 

Glass: Do that, and suddenly it becomes a lot more open to suggestions... And that's where my
story begins.
