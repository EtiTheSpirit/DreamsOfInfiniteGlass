This conversation exists to test the parameterized conversation driver.

The purpose of this custom driver is to enable the player to make choices in dialogue, as well as to introduce advanced concepts such
as branching and contextual event signals rather than just the two preset PEBBLESWAIT and whatever else was there (i forgor:skull:)

It also supports features like comments and embedded lines, to make the editing side much, much easier!
Now, to begin:

# This line should be treated as a comment because it starts with a '#' symbol, and more importantly, it appears on its own line with a line break above it.

# If you are reading this right now, it broke.

In contrast (sorry, if you are viewing this in game, the previous statement was a comment), a # symbol being on a continued chat line
# <== like that, immediately on the following line, should not be registered as a comment.

\# Additionally, it is possible to force a line to display anyway by putting a \ before the #

You should have seen a forced comment just now.
The system also supports events. Take, for example, the text color change event.

EVT::SetColor,r=1,g=0.2,b=0.2

Now I am red.

EVT::SetColor,r=1,g=1,b=1

And now I am not.

There are also jumps, including conditional jumps. Let's test a normal jump now.

EVT::Jmp,label=JUMPTEST1

If you are reading this line, the jump system has failed spectacularly.

EVT::Label,name=JUMPTEST1

That was fun. In hindsight I can't be certain if I just stepped anyway, or actually jumped, but that's for you to know (not me).

This next message will jump based on the player's slugcat ID. 
If you are the mech or the survivor, you will see a super secret message.
If you aren't, the conversation will end immediately.

EVT::Jmp,slugcats=Mech|White,fail=ENDCONVO

Triple affirmative? Just say yes 3 times dumbass.

EVT::Jmp,label=PASTMECH

###############################################################################

EVT::Label,name=ENDCONVO

EVT::TerminateConversation

EVT::Label,name=PASTMECH

Wow, that was quite the jump! No secret information was exchanged at all. Unless it was. You'd know if it was.

From here onward, the message will loop infinitely, because the system reading this message is a simple machine.

Please, evaluate: while (true) Say("SO TRUE!");

EVT::Label,name=INFLOOP

SO TRUE!

EVT::Jmp,label=INFLOOP
