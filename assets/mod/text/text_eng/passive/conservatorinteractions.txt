MESSAGE FROM GLASS => "I see you have found The Conservator. If you ever wonder how I manage such
a complex facility, this is how. This handles a lot of the work of managing the newer systems on 
my behalf, including you, ordinarily. Recent circumstances have led me to assume manual oversight."
MESSAGE FROM SYSTEM => "Hello, SOLSTICE."

=> "You do seem particularly interested in me. I am sentient to an extent, you know.
Much like Glass, I too am biomechanical. A large organic neural core sits behind this wall panel,
you can probably see some of its mass poking through the walls here. I use Glass's systems and share 
them in real time. In a way, he and I are one and the same, save for my independent core."

=> "My systems are mostly isolated from those outside of the Transition Seal. It is a security 
measure and I believe it makes complete sense, for a reason now wonderfully highlighted by our current 
dilemma: Any rogue systems that were to access the core functions of the superstructure would pose an 
immediate and potentially terminal risk to Glass."

systemic entities... But - and forgive me for potentially coming off as selfish - I *am* in quite
an unideal situation. Given the fact that your purpose is to resolve this issue, I would very much 
appreciate if you were to go and complete your task. The rogue systems are .. how can I phrase this
politely? ...Noisy? Persistent? Oh, who am I kidding. They are insufferable!"
