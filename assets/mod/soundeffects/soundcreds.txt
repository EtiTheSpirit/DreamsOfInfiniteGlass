A lot of SFX here came from various other games and mods, I know some are in public domain 
but others I am not so sure of. Still, for any other people who like SFX (and perhaps to
paint my own hands red) here's the primary/secondary/tertiary/etc. sources of the SFX

glass-conduitbuzz					: "Robocraft" Respawned & Overclocked update, fusion shield blocking nanotech beam
glass-devicewarn					: "Robocraft", electroplate failure alarm
glass-gigaboom						: "Risk of Rain 2" Void Devastator implosion, mixed with the RW thunder sound.
glass-industrialalarm				: "Spiral Knights", but I am pretty sure this is just a real alarm
glass-stockshock					: "Spiral Knights"
glass-singularitybuilup				: Literally just the two singularity bomb sounds stitched together.
glass-mech-broken					: "Fe", from one of the antagonists' suits of armor whilst broken
